    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium carrots, diced</li>
        <li>2 large waxy type potatos</li>
        <li>2 small onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 celery stalk, finely chopped</li>
        <li>500ml beef stock</li>
        <li>200ml coconut milk</li>
        <li>4tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>2tbsp flour</li>
        <li>1tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1tsp honey</li>
        <li>1tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rapseed oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by heating 2tbsp of rapseed oil in a medium-sized pot.</li>
        <li>Add 2 diced onions and half of a finely chopped celery stick to the pot. Sweat the ingredients on medium heat for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn up the heat slightly and add 2 diced carrots and 2 large diced potatoes to the pot. Fry until the vegetables start to brown. You may need to add a little bit more oil at this step.</li>
        <li>Next, pour in 500ml of beef stock, 1 tbsp of soy sauce, and 1 tbsp of mirin. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the vegetables are soft and tender, around 20-25 minutes (If you're using sweet potatoes, the cooking time might be shorter).</li>
        <li>While the vegetables are cooking, prepare the curry roux. In a small frying pan, heat 3 tbsp of oil and add 4 cloves of sliced garlic. Cook until the garlic is browned, then add 4 tsp of curry powder and 2 tbsp of plain flour. Cook on low heat for a minute to combine.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes and carrots are cooked to your desired texture, add 200ml of coconut milk and 1 tsp of honey to the pot. Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the curry roux to thicken the sauce, taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve the curry with a side of rice and sliced green chili. </li>
    </ol>
